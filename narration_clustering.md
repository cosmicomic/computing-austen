## Clustering Narration

Since I isolated dialog from narration, I thought I should might as well see how clustering and generating sentence sequences on narration only would turn out.

## The Clusters ##

-   cried he, catching the same tone;  And there was silence between them for a little while
-  The Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school, bringing with them Mrs Harville's little children, to improve the noise of Uppercross, and lessen that of Lyme
- As soon as I could use my hands she taught me to knit, which has been a great amusement; and she put me in the way of making these little thread-cases, pin-cushions and card-racks, which you always find me so busy about, and which supply me with the means of doing a little good to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood

### Cluster 1 ###
-  It was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down; but Anne was startled at finding him nearer than she had supposed, and half inclined to suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been occupied by them, striving to catch sounds, which yet she did not think he could have caught
- As soon as he could, he began to talk to her of Lyme, wanting to compare opinions respecting the place, but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance of their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time; to give his own

-  An hour's complete leisure for such reflections as these, on a dark November day, a small thick rain almost blotting out the very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows, was enough to make the sound of Lady Russell's carriage exceedingly welcome; and yet, though desirous to be gone, she could not quit the Mansion House, or look an adieu to the Cottage, with its black, dripping and comfortless veranda, or even notice through the misty glasses the last humble tenements of the village, without a saddened heart

### Cluster 2 ###

-  She had already been obliged to tell Lady Russell that Louisa Musgrove was to marry Captain Benwick
-  Their conversation the preceding evening did not disincline him to seek her again; and they walked together some time, talking as before of Mr Scott and Lord Byron, and still as unable as before, and as unable as any other two readers, to think exactly alike of the merits of either, till something occasioned an almost general change amongst their party, and instead of Captain Benwick, she had Captain Harville by her side
- He had no sooner been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days of Louisa's accident, no sooner be
gun to feel himself alive again, than he had begun to feel himself, though alive, not at liberty

### Cluster 3 ###
-   said Captain Harville
-       cried Louisa,    said he, smiling
