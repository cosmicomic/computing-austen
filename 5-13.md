### 5/13 Update ###

#### Highlights ####
My algorithm seemed to have generated some pretty existential prose, which reminded me of Virginia Woolf's *To the Lighthouse* (which is one of my favorite novels) and other modernist works.

- "The anxieties of common life began soon to succeed to the window, fidgeted about, hummed a tune, and seemed wholly self-occupied."
- Catherine, recollecting herself, grew ashamed of having explained them. 
 “Yes, but you forget that your mother died.”
- "They were viewing the country with the common feelings of common life, than with the same hand, marked an expenditure scarcely more interesting, in letters, hair-powder, shoe-string, and breeches-ball."

#### Process ####

The process for doing this was somewhat complicated and grungy. Here is an explanation: 

- I was able to separate dialog from narration pretty cleanly, which allowed me to create a 2-state Markov chain to model transitions between dialog and narration. 
- Using code I wrote earlier in the project, I ran clustering on dialog and narration separately, obtaining Markov chains corresponding to dialog clusters and narration clusters. 
	- I also computed state transition probability matrices for dialog and narration. 
- Then, I generated a probable sequence of narration and dialog based on the higher-order 2-state Markov chain. I set the length of the sequence to be 100 sentences, to approximate a chapter. 
	- For each continuous block of *n* sentences of narration or dialog, I pretended I was generating a paragraph of length *n* of narration or dialog, respectively. I used my earlier process of generating a probable state sequence of length *n* based on a state transition probability matrix. Then, for each state, I had the corresponding Markov chain generate a sentence.
	- In order to make the dialog look more like dialog, I surrounded each dialog sentence with quotation marks and put it on a new line.
- Finally, I took the entire generated text, pasted it into a Word document, and manually formatted it by indenting each line of dialog and the beginning of each paragraph.
